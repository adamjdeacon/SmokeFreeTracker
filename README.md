# Smoke Free Tracker

After 30 years of smoking 20 a day, I finally had the motivation to give up!

I originally used the NHS Smoke Free App, which was great for the first 28 days but after this, it
started getting buggy, like skipping days in calculations, dodgy reminders, and the motivation
started to slip.

So I built this!

It does what it needs to, and not a lot else.

It's not configurable in any way, and that's just the way I like it!

But, it is very motivating, lightweight and works every time (unless I've broken it)

Enjoy and if you're giving up too, best of luck!
